# TrustPilot's Pony Challenge

### How it works

Save the pony from the Domokun by helping it escape the maze.\
The idea is to follow the wall on the left or right side of the pony. That way the pony should be able to escape any
maze (unless caught by the Domokun, of course).

Create mazes, search for existing ones and run them while playing with the settings.

- Stop and start the maze as you wish.
- Follow the movement of the pony and the Domokun.
- See the status of the maze.
- Change the speed of which the pony and Domokun moves.
- Switch from following the left wall to following the right one or vice versa.
- Get a visual indication of the result when the pony escapes or is caught by the Domokun.
